(7th project)
This code processes the Yellow Taxi Trip Data and uses a Decision Tree Regressor to predict the tip_amount. Here's a breakdown of the steps:

Breakdown of Code:
Data Preprocessing:

The dataset is read from the provided CSV file.

The correlation between the features and the tip_amount is calculated and visualized using a horizontal bar plot.

Feature Extraction and Normalization:

The target variable tip_amount is separated from the rest of the dataset (y).

The feature matrix (X) is extracted by dropping the tip_amount column.

The features (X) are normalized using the L1 norm to scale them in the range of 0 to 1, making them easier to compare.

Train-Test Split:

The data is split into training and testing sets (70% for training, 30% for testing) using train_test_split.

Decision Tree Regressor Model:

A DecisionTreeRegressor from scikit-learn is used for training.

The model is configured with a maximum depth of 8 for simplicity, limiting the depth of the tree to prevent overfitting.

The model is trained on the training data (X_train and y_train).

Model Evaluation:

Predictions are made on the test set (X_test), and the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R¬≤ scores are calculated to assess the model's performance.

Feature Importance:

The top 3 features most correlated with tip_amount are identified using the correlation matrix.

Irrelevant features (payment_type, VendorID, store_and_fwd_flag, and improvement_surcharge) are dropped from the dataset to improve the model's performance.

Key Outputs:
MSE (Mean Squared Error): This value indicates the average squared difference between actual and predicted tip amounts. The lower the MSE, the better the model's predictions.

R¬≤ Score: This measures how well the model explains the variance in tip_amount. A higher R¬≤ indicates better model performance.

Top 3 Features: The top 3 features most correlated with tip_amount are printed for feature selection.

Suggestions for Improvement:
Hyperparameter Tuning: You can experiment with adjusting hyperparameters (like max_depth, min_samples_split, etc.) for better performance.

Visualization: You may want to visualize the decision tree itself or check feature importance to understand the model's behavior more effectively.

Model Comparison: You could try other models, such as Random Forest or XGBoost, to compare their performance with the Decision Tree.

(8th project)
This code trains a simple linear regression model to predict CO2 emissions based on the engine size from a dataset (FuelConsumptionCo2.csv). Here's a breakdown of each section:

Breakdown of the Code:
Reading and Preparing Data:

The dataset is loaded using pd.read_csv, and the relevant columns ENGINESIZE and CO2EMISSIONS are selected into cdf for analysis.

The relationship between Engine Size and CO2 Emissions is visualized using a scatter plot to understand the data.

Splitting Data into Training and Testing:

The data is randomly split into 80% for training and 20% for testing using a boolean mask (msk).

Training data (train) and test data (test) are defined using the mask.

Training the Linear Regression Model:

The model is trained using the LinearRegression class from scikit-learn.

The training data x_train (engine size) and y_train (CO2 emissions) are used to fit the model.

Model Coefficients:

The coefficient (slope) and intercept of the linear regression model are printed. The slope tells you the relationship between engine size and CO2 emissions (how much CO2 increases for each unit increase in engine size).

Visualizing the Regression Line:

The model‚Äôs prediction is plotted along with the actual training data to visualize the regression line. The red line represents the best-fit line predicted by the model.

Predictions on the Test Set:

Predictions (y_pred) are made using the test data x_test (engine size).

The actual and predicted test values are visualized in a scatter plot to compare the model's performance.

Model Evaluation:

The Residual Sum of Squares (MSE) is calculated using the formula
where the smaller the MSE, the better the model's predictions.

The Variance Score (R¬≤) is calculated using regr.score(), which tells you how well the model explains the variance in the test data. An R¬≤ of 1 means perfect predictions, and an R¬≤ of 0 means the model does not explain any of the variance.

Example Output:
Coefficients: The slope and intercept of the regression line are printed.

MSE: This value tells you how well the model fits the data. A smaller value means a better fit.

R¬≤: This value indicates how much of the variance in the test data is explained by the model.

simple task1
This code performs simple linear regression using the dataset X and y, which are related by a linear relationship (with y = 2 * X). Here's an explanation of each step in the code:

1. Data Setup:
X represents the independent variable (features), and y represents the dependent variable (target).

The data points are straightforward: as X increases, y increases at a constant rate, reflecting a simple linear relationship.

2. Data Splitting:
The dataset is split into training and test sets using train_test_split. 20% of the data is used for testing (test_size=0.2).

3. Model Training:
A Linear Regression model is created and trained on the training data (X_train, y_train).

4. Predictions:
The model makes predictions (y_pred) on all the data points (X).

5. Plotting:
The actual data points are plotted as blue dots.

The prediction line (regression line) is plotted in red, showing the fitted linear model.

Labels, title, legend, and grid are added to make the plot clear and readable.

Result:
The plot will show the original data points as blue dots and the fitted regression line as a red line, which should ideally pass through or near all the points (since the data follows a perfect linear relationship).

t-SNE, UMAP
This code demonstrates the use of t-SNE, UMAP, and PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualizing 3D data in 2D. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what‚Äôs happening in each part of the code:

1. Synthetic Data Generation:
You generate synthetic 3D data using make_blobs, creating four distinct clusters in a 3D space. Each cluster is given a different standard deviation to make them vary in size.

The data is stored in a DataFrame (df) for easy plotting with Plotly.

2. 3D Visualization (Using Plotly):
You create an interactive 3D scatter plot of the data using Plotly Express. This visualization lets you rotate and explore the clusters in 3D space.

Colors are assigned to the clusters to help visually distinguish them.

3. Standardizing the Data:
The data is scaled using StandardScaler to standardize the features (i.e., make the mean 0 and variance 1). This ensures that each feature contributes equally to the dimensionality reduction process.

4. Dimensionality Reduction:
t-SNE:

You reduce the 3D data to 2D using t-SNE. t-SNE is a popular technique for high-dimensional data visualization, particularly for preserving local structure.

After fitting the model, you plot the 2D representation, with the colors representing different clusters.

UMAP:

You also apply UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) to reduce the dimensions to 2D. UMAP is a newer technique that often works well for preserving both local and global structures.

Again, the 2D projection is visualized with the cluster labels as colors.

PCA:

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is another dimensionality reduction technique. Unlike t-SNE and UMAP, PCA aims to preserve the global variance in the data.

The 2D representation from PCA is plotted, showing how it preserves the relative densities and separations between clusters.

5. Comparing the Methods:
t-SNE and UMAP are often used when visualizing data in lower dimensions, especially for capturing the complex, non-linear relationships in the data. However, these methods can sometimes take a long time to converge, depending on the dataset.

PCA is a simpler method that uses linear transformations to reduce dimensions while retaining the maximum variance. It's faster and often performs well when the data can be captured by linear relationships.

Insights:
PCA often outperforms t-SNE and UMAP in terms of speed and simplicity, especially when the data naturally fits into linear structures.

t-SNE and UMAP are more computationally expensive and may not always yield better results compared to PCA, especially on simpler datasets.

Each dimensionality reduction technique has its strengths and use cases: PCA for speed and simplicity, and t-SNE/UMAP for complex, non-linear data patterns.
